# StateHistoricalMuseum3D

3D model of The State Historical Museum in Moscow, Russia was created from scratch in **Blender**. The AR app was created in **Unity3D** using **Vuforia** AR camera for image recognition.<br>

In the *Download* folder you can find the APK file and also the image used for image recognition.

Below are some images of the rendered object in Blender:<br>
